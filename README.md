## About Me

In 2021, I founded SVECTOR with the aim of exploring the deeper layers of AI, mathematics, and computer science. My focus has always been on building systems that are thoughtful, efficient, and grounded in strong technical foundations.

My work spans backend infrastructure, cross-platform development, and research-driven AI. I’m especially drawn to problems that require a mix of logic, creativity, and persistence — whether in algorithms, architecture, or applied models.
